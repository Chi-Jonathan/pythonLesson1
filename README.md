# Python Lesson 1
For the first lesson we are creating a calculator

## Necessary Knowledge:

### Variables
x = 1
y = 4
z = 7
x = 5

### Functions
def add(n1, n2):
    return n1 + n2

### Input/Output
print(“Hello World”)
x = int(input("Pick the correct answer"))

### Elif
If, elif, and else
if x == 1:
  …

  …
elif and else are optional

### Comments
\# This is how you comment,  just use the hashtag/pound symbol


## What you need to do
Create a simple calculator that has a function to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers input by the user. The functions must be named add, subtract, multiply, and divide. 
The user is asked to select from 1 (add), 2 (subtract), 3 (multiply), 4 (divide)
Then the user is asked to input the first number of the equation
Then after inputting the first number the user is asked to input the second number of the equation
The only file you need to edit is main.py, ignore the rest.
